[00:09.65] The club isn't the best place to find a lover
[00:12.09] So the bar is where I go (mm-mm)
[00:14.81] Me and my friends at the table doing shots
[00:17.03] Drinking fast, and then we talk slow (mm-mm)
[00:19.69] You come over and start up a conversation with just me
[00:22.23] And trust me, I'll give it a chance now (mm-mm)
[00:24.42] Take my hand, stop, put "Van the Man" on the jukebox
[00:27.26] And then we start to dance
[00:28.91] And now I'm singing like
[00:40.90] 
[00:29.82] Girl, you know I want your love
[00:32.21] Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[00:35.22] Come on now, follow my lead
[00:37.31] I may be crazy, don't mind me
[00:39.64] Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much
[00:42.28] Grab on my waist and put that body on me"
[00:45.29] Come on now, follow my lead
[00:47.28] Come, come on now, follow my lead
[00:49.17] (Mm-mm)
[00:52.67] 
[00:50.75] I'm in love with the shape of you
[00:53.14] We push and pull like a magnet do
[00:55.68] Although my heart is falling too
[00:58.14] I'm in love with your body
[01:00.60] Last night you were in my room
[01:03.18] And now my bed sheets smell like you
[01:05.34] Every day discovering something brand new
[01:08.01] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[01:23.01] 
[01:10.01] Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
[01:13.14] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[01:14.89] Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
[01:18.04] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[01:19.98] Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
[01:23.04] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[01:25.04] Every day discovering something brand new
[01:28.39] I'm in love with the shape of you
[01:44.89] 
[01:29.89] One week in we let the story begin
[01:31.95] We're going out on our first date (mm-mm)
[01:34.34] But you and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
[01:36.90] Fill up your bag, and I fill up a plate (mm-mm)
[02:00.40] 
[01:39.53] We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
[01:41.95] And how your family is doing okay (mm-mm)
[01:44.54] And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the back seat
[01:47.15] Tell the driver make the radio play
[01:48.70] And I'm singing like
[01:58.70] 
[01:50.15] Girl, you know I want your love
[01:52.20] Your love was handmade for somebody like me
[01:55.39] Come on now, follow my lead
[01:57.26] I may be crazy, don't mind me
[01:59.57] Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much
[02:02.26] Grab on my waist and put that body on me"
[02:05.31] Come on now, follow my lead
[02:07.12] Come, come on now, follow my lead
[02:09.16] (Mm-mm)
[02:12.66] 
[02:10.56] I'm in love with the shape of you
[02:13.03] We push and pull like a magnet do

[02:20.56] Last night you were in my room
[02:23.18] And now my bed sheets smell like you
[02:25.25] Every day discovering something brand new
[02:28.15] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[02:43.15] 
[02:30.03] Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I

[02:34.90] Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
[02:38.08] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[02:40.03] Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
[02:43.09] Oh, I'm in love with your body
[02:45.03] Every day discovering something brand new
[02:48.28] I'm in love with the shape of you
[03:04.78] 
[02:50.11] Come on, be my baby, come on

[03:18.11] I'm in love with your body
[03:20.52] Last night you were in my room
[03:23.12] And now my bed sheets smell like you
[03:25.38] Every day discovering something brand new

[03:43.18] 
[03:30.27] Come on, be my baby, come on
[03:32.65] Come on, be my baby, come on (I'm in love with your body)
[03:35.19] Come on, be my baby, come on
[03:37.53] Come on, be my baby, come on (oh, I'm in love with your body)
