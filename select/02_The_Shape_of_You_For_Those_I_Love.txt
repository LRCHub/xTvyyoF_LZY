Jesus man, please, please be careful with yourself, will you?
Don't want you gettin' yourself into trouble, you know what I mean?
But, eh, get yourself home safe there, but
Eh and anyway, love ya, see you soon and take care of yourself

This is the first song I've made in months
In a box bedroom beside a death in a book
I just told me Ma the treatments not working and she understands
I see the tears in her eyes and the care in her hands
Sometimes that's all ya need to find the strength to breathe
I have a family I love and they love me

I still see you smile as you float in the sky
Miles high as you rise
Still clear in my eyes
Still as bright as every night we danced til 5
I still see the light in every one of the boys
My guides out of the dark of night
So I will try

Doing 5 tracks a day
For two summers
I deserve to make it through these traumas
These songs are here to pay honour
To those left that flock together like birds over Tolka
My way is to make stay
Feel those flames burn the shame
As the boys blaze jays for days at my Ma's place
And I finally feel OK

If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
If you look closer, it's easy to trace

Wake up in a hospital bed out of me head and me leg snapped in two
No clue where I am or what to do
Bouncing in and out of sleep
Too weak to speak and no heat in the white sheets
No money, no passport and totally alone
Dead battery in me phone
Just the groans of post surgery fear
Nobody here will speak to me
All I find out is I'm in Belgium and had an accident the night before
No less and no more
Just the growing terror of 18 year old fear roars
Til your dumb head rocks in the door
With a bottle of Coke in your hand
And another one of the boys by your side
Smiles for miles as I see safety in sight
And you bounce me into a wheelchair
And run me out into the freedom of night
No meds to heal the head
No bread to stay fed
Just crutches and a cast up my leg
Take me home across trains and planes until we meet Dublin rain
And me Da losing his fucking mind
And me Ma crying
And you secretly in delight at the sight of all the madness
Ya said stories to tell never breed sadness
They treat it
And if you can grasp it
Own it, deal with it
You can heal with it
So I'll heal with it

Patient and free
Will heal the pain that's left in me
And that's the truth
The fear in my bones
Is the only growth I know
We had our youth
Patient and free
Will heal the pain that's left in me
And that's the truth
The fear in my bones
Is the only growth I know
We had our youth

What's up baby, rise and shine
Hope you're up early on this glorious Saturday morning. But, eh
Just thought I'd send you a quick message to say
I love you first and foremost
I miss you second, and third
I can't wait to see you Sunday
Get yourself up of that bed now and get busy for the day and, eh

Oh shit, yeah
Oh that'd be brilliant
